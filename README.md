# fourier_series
This repository implements the Fourier series approximation of an even, periodic square wave using Python. The signal is expanded using cosine terms with odd harmonics only. The code demonstrates harmonic summation, convergence behavior, and the Gibbs phenomenon through numerical visualization.
